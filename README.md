This repository contains a labs to help you get started with Creating and deploying Azure machine learning module.

### VS Code Remote - Containers
Follow these steps to open this sample in a container using the VS Code Remote - Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

    - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Try a Sample...** command.
    - Choose the "Python" sample, wait for the container to start, and try things out!
        > **Note:** Under the hood, this will use the **Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred mechanism for persisting container data.   

   Or open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

3. **Rebuild or update your container**

   You may want to make changes to your container, such as installing a different version of a software or forwarding a new port. You'll rebuild your container for your changes to take effect. 

   **Open browser automatically:** As an example change, let's update the `portsAttributes` in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to open a browser when our port is automatically forwarded.
   
   - Open the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.
   - Modify the `"onAutoForward"` attribute in your `portsAttributes` from `"notify"` to `"openBrowser"`.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** command so the modifications are picked up.  

## Labs

After you've completed the setup steps above, you can use your Visual Studio Online environment to complete the labs.


> **Note**: Labs that involve running code include all of the code you'll need - you'll just need to copy and paste a few values and run the code that is provided, so don't worry if you're not a programmer! We've used Python code in the labs, because that can be runs interactively in the notebooks themselves.
